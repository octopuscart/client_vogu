                    Vogue Tailors was founded Mr. Bhat Zahoor and Mr. Farooq Shalla with the belief that bespoke does not have to mean expensive. Most people would agree that a bespoke suit, hand cut and stitched by a skilled tailor, would look and fit much better than an off-the-peg suit.

                    However, people can be put off by the prices - that need not be the case.

                    At Vogue Tailors we can make a suit to your exact specifications using many of the traditional Shanghainese bespoke tailoring techniques at an affordable price. Once you've had a custom made suit, made for you by our highly skilled bespoke tailor you will never want to go back to buying off the peg. We believe that quality should never be compromised.                </p>

                            I always approach to Vogue Tailors for many reasons, one because I know what the quality they give, second because nothing ever fits (Square shoulders, Baggy trousers, bit of a gut) and thirdly because I always look to stand out from the ground. Sometimes before, I needed a wedding suit and I directly approached Vogue Tailors, and I am greatly impressed with what is being made for me. Honesty in giving an advice to customers is the main key point that you will love. Anyone who wants bespoke tailored suit, just go to Vogue Tailors. There is no benefit to ring other tailors. This is my personal experience that I am telling you.
